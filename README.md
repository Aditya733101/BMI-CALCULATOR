Purpose:
The BMI calculator is designed to estimate a person's body fat based on their height and weight.
It provides a numerical value that categorizes individuals into different weight categories, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

Calculation:
BMI is calculated using the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m)).
The weight is typically measured in kilograms (kg) and the height in meters (m).
The height is usually squared in the formula to account for the difference in scaling between weight and height.

Input:
The user provides their height and weight as input to the calculator.
Height is usually entered in centimeters (cm) or meters (m), and weight in kilograms (kg).
These values are then used to compute the BMI using the formula mentioned earlier.

Output:
The output of the BMI calculator is a numerical value representing the calculated BMI.
This value is then interpreted to determine the individual's weight category based on predefined ranges.
